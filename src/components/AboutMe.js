        After deciding upon a programming type project for my masterâ€™s
        dissertation, I began my descent into the world of development. After
        self-teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I began
        developing different websites and projects. With the skills I gained
        through my chemistry degree I was able to quickly grasp the logic behind
        various frameworks and am now looking forward to taking this passion
        further to become a more proficient and most importantly, an efficient
        engineer.
