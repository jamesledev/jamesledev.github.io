      'Saigon Vietnamese Restaurant is the restaurant where I worked during my teenage years, it was owned by my family and so of course I was forced to work thereâ€¦ I needed practise building websites on React.js and so I borrowed the photos that we took before and created this website in one day. It is also a responsive design and so works across other media sizes. ',

    description:
      'Genshin Impact is a game that I have played essentially from release. I wanted to find a website that would allow me to plan out visual build paths for my characters. It being a relatively new game however, resulted in a lack of fan made websites, and so I decided to build it myself. There were, however, text-only build paths that I could as references in my project. By using a google-sheets-api I was able to extract the information which would then be used as the guide alongside a more visual part where the user would have the ability to drag images corresponding to the guide to designated areas. This was done by using a plug-in called draggable and was built mainly on express, node.js.',

      'This was the first project I attempted after taking a multitude of Skillshare courses. Using express on node.js I created a pokedex (Pokemon info bank) and an item bank by using axios to request info via request/promise and async/await from a pokemon-api. As this is my first ever project there is a lot lacking in the CSS department, however, in the short time it took me to complete the project my back-end JS and css skills rose exponentially.',
