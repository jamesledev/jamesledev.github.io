            After deciding upon a programming type project for my master’s
            dissertation, I began my descent into the world of development.
            After self-teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I
            began developing different websites and projects. Using skills I
            gained through my chemistry degree I was able to quickly grasp the
            logic behind various different frameworks and am now looking forward
            to taking this passion further to become a more proficient and most
            importantly, an efficient engineer. <br /> <br />
            Outside of my passion for programming comes my want for clout on
            instagram. Joking aside i spend most of my time playing games,
            watching korean dramas or playing badminton. <br /> <br /> Feel free
            send an email my way with any questions! If there is one thing I can
            guarentee, its the speed at which I reply to emails at. <br />
