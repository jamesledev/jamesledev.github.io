            After deciding upon a programming type project for my masterâ€™s
            dissertation, I began my descent into the world of development.
            After self-teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I
            began developing different websites and projects. With the skills I
            gained through my chemistry degree I was able to quickly grasp the
            logic behind various frameworks and am now looking forward to taking
            this passion further to become a more proficient and most
            importantly, an efficient engineer.
